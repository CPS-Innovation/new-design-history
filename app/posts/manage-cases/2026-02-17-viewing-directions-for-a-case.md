The [direction list](/manage-cases/redesigning-the-direction-list/) shows all directions across all cases.

The case direction list shows all the directions for a single case in one place.

## How it works

Users get to the case direction list by navigating to a case and clicking "Directions" in the case navigation.

The page shows all open directions for the case, sorted by due date.

Each direction shows:

- direction description (as a link)
- status tag (if applicable)
- defendant (if applicable)
- prosecutor
- paralegal officer
- due date (with days remaining or overdue status)
- assignee (Prosecution or Defence)
- latest note (if applicable)
- custody time limit (if applicable)
- hearing date and type (if applicable)

We only show fields that have values.
