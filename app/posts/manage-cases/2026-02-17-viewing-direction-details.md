title: Viewing direction details

At the moment, direction details are shown in an expanding row within the direction list.

This squeezes a lot of information into a single page, making it harder to read and action.

A separate page gives each direction the space it needs and is simpler to navigate.

## How it works

Clicking a direction in the [case direction list](/manage-cases/viewing-directions-for-a-case/) or the [direction list](/manage-cases/redesigning-the-direction-list/) takes the user to the details page.

The page heading shows the direction description and a status tag if applicable.

Three actions are available:

- Complete direction - starts the flow to complete the direction
- Delete - deletes the direction
- Add note - adds a note to the direction

The summary list shows:

- title
- description (with a change link)
- defendant (if applicable)
- assignee
- due date (with a change link)
- custody time limit (if applicable)
- unit

Where a case has a hearing, a separate hearing section shows the details of the hearing.

The notes section shows all notes added to the direction.
