title: Making it easier to find, organise and work with case materials

#### How we are researching and designing a way for users to find, organise and work with case materials in large and complex cases.

This work focused on testing whether the initial manage case materials designs, based earlier insight, allowed operational delivery colleagues to work effectively with large and complex cases.

The primary aim was to understand whether users could:
* move materials between folders
* copy materials to create working copies
* find specific files using search
* rename files and place them in the correct location
* navigate folder structures at scale
