title:  Loss of pay updates
description: The current process makes it difficult for users to claim for loss of pay
date: 2023-01-20

* We changed policy based on UR to make it easier for users to claim for loss of pay.
* Users don't need to work out (or ask their employers) how much they lost by taking an unpaid day off work.
